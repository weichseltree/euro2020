# euro2020

The dataset is taken from the interactive graphic https://www.zeileis.org/assets/posts/2021-06-07-euro2020/p_match.html
which is based on the analysis done by Andreas Groll, Lars Magnus Hvattum, Christophe Ley, Franziska Popp, Gunther Schauberger, Hans Van Eetvelde and Achim Zeileis which can be seen here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05799

While the notebooks in here do not aim to improve the predictions for the matches, they can provide predictions for exact goal numbers.
